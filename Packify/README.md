## Description

Packify is a web-based platform designed to optimize packaging box sizes in
order to increase the number of products transported per shipment. By analyzing
product dimensions and packaging constraints, the platform generates optimized
box dimensions that reduce wasted space, improve logistics efficiency, and
support cost-effective transportation.

The platform also includes a 3D simulation feature that visually represents how
products fit inside the optimized packaging, helping users better understand the
impact of the optimization.

## Current Progress

The BoxOptima platform currently includes the following pages:

**Package & Product Form Page:**
Allows users to input product dimensions, quantity, and packaging constraints
required for optimization.

**Optimization Results Page:**
Showcases the optimized box dimensions along with efficiency metrics such as
space utilization and size reduction.

**3D Simulation Page:**
Displays an interactive 3D visualization showing how products are arranged
inside the optimized packaging.

**Download Report Page:**
Enables users to download the optimization report and confirms that the report
has been successfully generated and downloaded.

## Examples for Contributors

To enhance the platform, contributors can design or add the following features
and improvements:

**Dashboard / Overview Page:**
Design a summary dashboard displaying key metrics such as total products
optimized, space saved, and efficiency percentage. Include quick navigation
options for starting new optimizations or viewing previous runs.

**Optimization Comparison Page:**
Create a before-and-after comparison view for original and optimized box sizes.
Add charts or visual indicators to highlight volume reduction and efficiency
improvements.

**History / Previous Runs Page:**
Design a page that lists past optimization runs with details such as date,
product count, and efficiency score. Include options to view or re-run previous
optimizations.

**3D Simulation Enhancements:**
Improve the 3D view by adding rotate, zoom, and pan controls. Add toggles to
switch between original and optimized packaging views and visually highlight
unused space.

**Sustainability Impact Page:**
Design a page to show estimated material savings and reduced packaging waste
based on the optimization results.

**UI/UX Improvements:**
Enhance form usability by converting inputs into a step-by-step flow. Improve
responsiveness, spacing, and micro-interactions across all pages.

**Dark Mode Integration:**
Design a toggle switch for light and dark modes. Ensure readability, proper color
contrast, and compatibility of charts, icons, and 3D visuals in dark mode.

## Requirements for Contributors

To enhance functionality and design, contributors should focus on:

**Usability:**
Ensure the interface is intuitive, responsive, and easy to navigate across
devices.

**Visual Hierarchy:**
Maintain consistency in typography, spacing, alignment, and color usage for a
clean and professional appearance.

**Accessibility:**
Follow accessibility standards including readable fonts, scalable text, proper
contrast ratios, and keyboard-friendly interactions.

## Guidelines for Contribution

Align with the existing design language to maintain visual and functional
consistency. Propose creative solutions that improve clarity, efficiency, or user
understanding while keeping the interface minimal and uncluttered. Test designs
for compatibility across multiple devices and browsers.
