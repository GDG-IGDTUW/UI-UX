## Description

GreenPulse is a smart product-impact analyzer designed for environmentally
conscious shoppers. The platform helps users quickly understand the
sustainability impact of everyday products through clear eco-scores,
easy-to-understand insights, and eco-friendly alternatives.

The goal of GreenPulse is to make sustainable shopping simple, transparent, and
actionable, enabling users to make better purchasing decisions without confusion
or additional effort.

## Problem Statement

Environmentally conscious consumers want to shop sustainably, but often lack
clear, reliable, and easy-to-understand information at the point of purchase.

Key challenges include:

* Eco-claims on packaging are often confusing or misleading
* Comparing products based on true environmental impact is difficult
* Users lack tools to track, reflect on, or feel rewarded for sustainable choices

---

## Design Challenge

**How might we simplify sustainability information and present it in a way that
is clear, trustworthy, and actionable during everyday shopping?**

## Opportunities for Contributors

### UX & Interaction Improvements

* Fix consistency issues in the bottom navigation bar caused by shared icons
  used for both animation and navigation
* Improve overall interaction smoothness and transition timing
* Reduce perceived lag in the scan-to-description flow
* Identify and fix responsiveness issues across screens, ensuring better layout
  adaptability for different device sizes

### Design Enhancements & New Concepts

* Refine visual hierarchy, spacing, and alignment across screens
* Design deeper product detail pages with detailed sustainability breakdowns
* Explore product comparison features based on eco-impact scores
* Create eco-impact insights or sustainability tracking screens
* Conceptualize reward or motivation systems to encourage sustainable choices

### Component & Design System Work

* Expand and organize the component library
* Standardize interaction states such as hover, active, loading, and error
  states
* Improve reusability and consistency of UI components

## Requirements for Contributors

To enhance the platform, contributors should focus on:

**Usability:**
Ensure intuitive navigation, smooth interactions, and responsive behavior across
all screens.

**Visual Hierarchy:**
Maintain consistency in typography, spacing, color usage, and alignment for
clarity and readability.

**Accessibility:**
Design with accessibility in mind, including readable text sizes, sufficient
contrast, and clear interaction cues.

## Contribution Guidelines

* Follow the existing design language and component structure
* Ensure all new designs are responsive and scalable
* Clearly label frames and document major design decisions
* Keep solutions simple, purposeful, and aligned with the project’s sustainability
  mission

This project provides an opportunity to contribute to a meaningful,
impact-driven product, strengthen mobile UI/UX and interaction design skills,
and explore how design can influence sustainable consumer behavior.

If you want next, I can:

* Make this **shorter for a portfolio or case study**
* Add a **“Good First Issues” section**
* Or standardize all your READMEs into **one reusable template**
