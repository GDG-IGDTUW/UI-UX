I have worked extensively on the UI and language of this project. On page 1, I worked on the language/text by changing it to a more calmer version. On both page 1 and 2, I have changed the color of many buttons, and if the project mentor likes the changes, so I can do the same for further pages or any other changes they would like to recommend.
